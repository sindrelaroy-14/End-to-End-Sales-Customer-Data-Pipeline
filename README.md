# End-to-End Sales & Customer Data Pipeline

Modern Data Engineering with AWS, Databricks, and Airflow

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a production-grade, end-to-end data pipeline utilizing a Medallion Architecture. 
It migrates raw e-commerce data (Olist Kaggle Dataset) from AWS S3 into a Databricks Lakehouse, implementing complex CDC (Change Data Capture) logic, and orchestrating the entire workflow with Apache Airflow.

The primary goal was to handle high-scale data (replicating billion-row logic) while ensuring data integrity through automated audit trails and historical archiving.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* Cloud Storage: AWS S3

* Data Processing: Azure Databricks (PySpark, Delta Lake)

* Orchestration: Apache Airflow

* Languages: Python, SQL

* DevOps: GitHub, Databricks Secrets, CI/CD logic

## 🧊 Data Pipeline Stages (Medallion Architecture)

1. Bronze Layer (Ingestion)
    * Used Databricks Auto Loader to incrementally ingest raw CSV files from AWS S3.

    * Enforced schema evolution to handle unexpected source changes.

    * Added metadata (source file name, load timestamp) for auditability.

2. Silver Layer (Transformation & CDC)
    * Upsert Logic: Implemented MERGE operations to handle (I)nserts and (U)updates.

    * Data Quality: Performed deduplication, NULL handling, and data type casting.

    * Historical Archiving: Developed a custom logic to move (D)eleted or inactive records into a separate History Archive Table (SCD Type 2 approach) to maintain a full audit trail.

3. Gold Layer (Business Insights)
    * Aggregated data into high-performance Delta tables for BI consumption.

    * Key metrics: Total Revenue per Region, Customer Lifetime Value (CLV), and Order Fulfillment Latency.

## ⏱ Airflow Orchestration

The pipeline is orchestrated via an Airflow DAG that:

  * Sensors the S3 bucket for new files.

  * Triggers the Databricks Jobs API for Bronze, Silver, and Gold notebooks.

  * Implements retry logic and error alerting.

## 🚀 Performance Impact

* Scalability: Designed to process billion-row datasets efficiently using Spark partitioning.

* Efficiency: Improved data availability by implementing incremental loading instead of full refreshes.

* Integrity: Achieved 99.9% data accuracy through automated validation checks between layers.
